                    Every new idea is a remix of one or more past ideas. The best coders don't invent from a vacuum. They study, deconstruct, and understand great codeâ€”from libraries, frameworks, and open-source projects. Your job is to collect good ideas. The more good ideas you collect, the more you can choose from to influence your own work.

                    Don't wait until you "feel ready" or have mastered every concept. The best way to learn is by doing. Start that side project. Build that silly app. Write that first line of code. It's okay to feel like an imposter; most of us do. Make things, learn from them, and you'll find your voice along the way.

                <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    Is there a tool that would make your life easier? A game you wish existed? Build it. Your own passion and needs are the best starting point for a project. If you create something you genuinely want, you're more likely to see it through. Chances are, other people want it too.

                <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    It's a two-step process. Step one, "do good work," is about focus and craftsmanship. Step two, "share it," is about putting your work out there. Push your code to GitHub. Write a blog post about what you learned. Tweet a screenshot of your progress. Sharing your process attracts a community of people who care about the same things you do.
